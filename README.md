# Implementation of [the drum machine of Tao ☯︎](https://red-x-silver.github.io/the-drum-machine-of-tao/)

_Tao_: a "symmetric" drum machine capable of both synthesizing audio waveforms from sequencer parameters as well as inferring sequencer parameters from audio waveforms.

## Note 2025/06/26
We are currently working on upgrading the expressiveness of _Tao_ - going from a 8-step sequencer to a 16-step sequencer + velocity parameter estimation. Code to be released in August 2025.

## Installation


## Usage


### Dataset preparation

We use [Freesound One-Shot Percussive Sounds](https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/freesound-one-shot-percussive-sounds) for synthesizing the drum loops. 

### Training


## Funding

This work is funded by UK Research and Innovation [grant number EP/S022694/1] as part of the “UKRI Centre for Doctoral Training in Artificial Intelligence and Music”.
